        <p id="about-her"> Bryna was born on March 24, 1940 in Philadelphia. 
          She was named Bryna Sandra Zappel, Bryna after her great grandmother and Sandra after her aunt.
          <br />Her childhood home was an apartment over a paint and hardware store. 
          <br />Her family didn't have enough money to heat up their house, so they used coal for lighting fires.

          <br />Each morning when first waking up, she had to quickly get dressed because her father used to bring clients up to the kitchen while he finished his breakfast.
          <br />One day coming back from school, her father was on a ladder reaching for paint and the whole shelve with all the paints fell on top of him. 
          <br>
          <br />When Bryna started going to school, World War II began. But thankfully her city wasn't hit.
          <br />In her locker at school she would put blankets, toys, coloring aids and a book so that if there were bombings they would run to the hall and sit there until it was over.
          <br />Her father had an important and dangerous job.  Every night after the siren, he had to check that all the windows were covered in black blankets so people wouldn't see them inside at night.
          <br>
          <br />In school they had to shower after gym class (they had a 10 minute break for it), and if she didn't shower, they would write a warning.
          <br />They also had sewing and cooking classes where she made a dress and a bib.
          <br>
          <br />Bryna used to sell cookies to earn money for trips and different activities.

          <br />She was in charge of watching for cars when the kids were crossing.
          She also had a job answering the phone for the principal.
          <br />Her childhood games were: jump rope, dodge ball, and kick-the-can.
          <br />
          <br />In high school, Bryna started working at the bank every Monday. 
          <br />For her end-of-year trip, they sailed to West Point in a huge disco boat.
          <br />The fashion at that time was dresses, short hair and high boots. The music was rock and roll.
          <br>
          <br />She loved a guy named Larry Goldberg and one day at a fair, they kissed. 
          She wrote about it in her dairy and was on cloud nine for 4 whole days. &#128525
          <br>
          <br />After high school, Bryna flew to England, France, Germany, Sweden, Italy and Holland.
          <br />She also went to Atlantic City and the mountains in Pennsylvia and there she met my grandfather.
          <br />They got married on April 8, 1962.
          And had 5 kids: Annette, my mom, Murray, Karen, Debra and Tivia.
          <br />She passed away in April 21, 2016. 
          <br> May God be with her, and may she always be in our memories &#128151
